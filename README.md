# SP2013_CrossSiteCollectionNavigation
This SharePoint 2013 farm solution illustrates a custom branding solution that illustrates the following:
1. Adding breadcrumb back to custom master page
2. Using a server side user control to display navigation from a term set for cross-site collection navigation, without the need to manually copy the term set
3. Providing alternate page for keyboard access to support Section 508 compliance
4. Applying custom master page with minimal changes from Seattle and very little .css
5. Applying master page without using Publishing feature by implementing a feature stapler
